# Pwnagotchi display-password.py plugin

Displays the most recent cracked password on the pwnagotchi display. Currently just reads the last line of the wpa-sec potfile generated by the pwnagotchi wpa-sec plugin. Screenshot:

# Installation

On your Pwnagotchi, overwrite the contents of `/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/pwnagotchi/plugins/default/memtemp.py` with the contents of `display-password.py` from this repo. Enable the memtemp plugin. I haven't spent any time reading about the proper way to add plugins so feel free to help out if you want.
